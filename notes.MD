- Tried signing up as a new user but was denied. Said user already exists. (Figured out that if the user puts in "-" between numbers then the signup fails but does work)
    works: (5555555555)  doesnt work: (555-555-5555)

- Nice work on setting up styling framework early. This will serve you well in the future

- Heroku is not up to date with your current code. Try to keep updated to make sure that deployment does not break

- If PWA then I would suggest implementing sooner than later

- Has the group thought about using React hooks? Good practice for your future career. Not necessary tho
    Not much to change if you decide to use hooks. So far just a useDispatch, useState, useSelector hooks needed to convert

- Using some old versions of react (router). not a big deal. just know that there are some changes to syntax in current version
