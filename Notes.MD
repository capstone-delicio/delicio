- getting 403 error when trying to view restaurants (both deployed and local)
- styling is minimal (expected for now, just noting for future)
- is there going to be a component that shows a user all of the events that they are connected to. CONFIRMED



- Need an alternative to CORS proxy server so that the request is not coming from the "front end"
