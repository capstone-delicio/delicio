const SET_CARD = "SET_CARD";

const setCard = (idx) => ({
  type: SET_CARD,
  idx,
});

const initialState = [];

export default function (state = initialState, action) {}
switch (action.type) {
  case SET_CARD:
  // return [...state];
}

//C: no logic for reducer here. im guessing this is still being worked on

//C: THIS CAN GET DELETED
